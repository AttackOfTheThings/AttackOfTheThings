Attack Of The Things

This is a first-person shooter set in a museum where the player must face different enemies, mostly zombies in order to get to the final stage in the end and escape. There is a wave-system which increases the amounts of enemies spawned per round, and a FSM system that dictates their behaviour. These enemies can be killed by shooting them with the standard M4 rifle. To proceed to the next level the player must stand on the blue pond.

- First person camera perspective with visible gun
